# AI-Powered-Predictive-Maintenance-for-Vehicles
Developed an AI-powered predictive maintenance system for vehicles that analyzes real-time sensor data like engine temperature, oil pressure, and battery voltage to forecast component failures. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and FastAPI, it provides real-time predictions via a REST API, helping reduce downtime and optimize maintenance schedules.
